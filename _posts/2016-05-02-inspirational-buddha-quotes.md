"Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without."

"To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him." 

"Teach this triple truth to all: A generous heart, kind speech, and a life of service and compassion are the things which renew humanity.'

"To keep the body in good health is a duty... otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear."

"Happiness will never come to those who fail to appreciate what they already have."

"We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves."

"Meditation brings wisdom; lack of meditation leaves ignorance. Know well what leads you forward and what hold you back, and choose the path that leads to wisdom."

"A man is not called wise because he talks and talks again; but if he is peaceful, loving and fearless then he is in truth called wise."

"The mind is everything. What you think you become."

"The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly."

"Whatever words we utter should be chosen with care for people will hear them and be influenced by them for good or ill."

"Meditate. Live purely. Be quiet. Do your work with mastery. Like the moon, come out from behind the clouds! Shine."
